## Quick Introduction:
> Do you have a Discord server? Are your users looking for a simpler way
> to open new text and voice lobbies on their own? Well, look no further
> our new Lobby Finder bot, will allow your community todo all of the
> above.

## Setup guide:
> **Automatic:** After inviting the bot, go into your bot-commands channel and run the command `$whitelist` in this very channel. By
> default every channel on the server is blacklisted from commands, so
> choose wisely, which channels you whitelist! Once you have whitelisted
> that channel run the automatic `$setup` command to finalize the setup
> of Lobby Finder bot.
> 
> **Manual:** If you don't want the bot to do all the work for you, run the setup command with the `-m` flag like this: `$setup -m`. The bot
> will then walk you through the setup process.
> 
> **Note:** The whitelist and setup commands requires you to have the `ADMINISTRATOR` permission. Make sure you have it.

## About:
> Our bot will help your server users connect with other users in a
> whole new way. This is the closest you will get to a party or lobby
> system directly in your Discord server. After inviting the bot and
> finishing its simple setup, users can create a lobby which creates a
> new voice and text channel. The new channels are only visible by
> anyone invited to the lobby by its owner or co-owner. 
> 
> Users are able to lock and unlock their lobby. They are able to join
> any open lobby using, and those lobbies get displayed in an
> automatically created channel. This is only scratching the surface of
> what our bot is capable of doing! So what are you waiting for, invite
> the bot into your server today!

## Premium Version:
> Since the very beginning we have been helping Discord server owners
> and users connect with one another in a whole new way. You can create
> text and voice channel lobbies directly in Discord without the need
> for a bunch of predefined channels for free.
> 
> To keep our bot and server updated as much as possible, we need
> developers, which can cost quite a bit of money. The bot also needs a
> hosting provider which is a monthly fee, so to combat this we have
> added in a few sweet features for our premium version of the bot. This
> is not required to use the bot, but it does give you a few extra perks
> which are listed below.
> 
>  - **Custom Lobby Names**  - Users can change their lobby name using the    name command inside their lobby.
>  - **Custom Lobby Colors** - Users can change their lobby embed color using    the color command inside their lobby.
>  - **Global Lobby Linking** - Users can link their lobby to another lobby on    your server or other premium servers from around the
> world.
>  - **Lobby Limit Increase** - All lobbies will increase their maximum    members allowed to 10 members for every new lobby.
>  - **Custom Bot Colors** - Server owners can change the main embed color    using the set command inside their server.
 
*All premium upgrades are intended for server owners to purchase for their own servers. If you are just looking to use the bot inside a server, it is absolutely free!*
