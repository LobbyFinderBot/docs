## Quick Introduction:
> Do you have a Discord server? Are your users looking for a simpler way to open new text and voice lobbies on their own? Well, look no further our new Lobby Finder bot, will allow your community todo all of the above.

## Setup guide:
> **Automatic:** After inviting the bot, go into your bot-commands channel and run the command `$whitelist` in this very channel. By default every channel on the server is blacklisted from commands, so choose wisely, which channels you whitelist! Once you have whitelisted that channel run the automatic `$setup` command to finalize the setup of Lobby Finder bot.
> 
> **Manual:** If you don't want the bot to do all the work for you, run the setup command with the `-m` flag like this: `$setup -m`. The bot will then walk you through the setup process.
> 
> **Note:** The whitelist and setup commands requires you to have the `ADMINISTRATOR` permission. Make sure you have it.

## About:
> Our bot will help your server users connect with other users in a whole new way. This is the closest you will get to a party or lobby system directly in your Discord server. After inviting the bot and finishing its simple setup, users can create a lobby which creates a new voice and text channel. The new channels are only visible by anyone invited to the lobby by its owner or co-owner. 
> 
> Users are able to lock and unlock their lobby. They are able to join any open lobby using, and those lobbies get displayed in an automatically created channel. This is only scratching the surface of what our bot is capable of doing! So what are you waiting for, invite the bot into your server today!

The bot also needs a hosting provider which is a monthly fee, so to combat this we have added in a few sweet features for our premium version of the bot.
